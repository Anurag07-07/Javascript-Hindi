Here's a detailed note explaining the given code and concepts used:

### **Notes on the Code**

1. **Variable Declaration and Initialization:**
   - `const accoundId = 144553`  
     - Declares a constant `accoundId` with the value `144553`.
     - Constants are immutable, meaning their value cannot be reassigned.
     - Attempting to reassign `accoundId` (e.g., `accoundId = 2`) will result in an error.
   - `let accountEmail = "anurag07raj@gmail.com"`  
     - Declares a variable `accountEmail` using `let` and initializes it with an email address.
     - `let` allows reassignment, so `accountEmail = "adityanv8@gmail.com"` is valid.
   - `var accountPassword = "12345"`  
     - Declares a variable `accountPassword` using `var` and initializes it with a password.
     - **Note:** Avoid using `var` because it has **functional scope** (not block-scoped), which can lead to unintended behavior.
   - `accountCity = "Greater Noida"`  
     - Assigns a value to an undeclared variable, implicitly making it global (in non-strict mode). 
     - It is better to explicitly declare variables using `let`, `const`, or `var`.
   - `let accountState;`  
     - Declares a variable `accountState` using `let` without initialization. Its value is `undefined` by default.

2. **Reassignment Examples:**
   - `accountEmail = "adityanv8@gmail.com"`  
     - Changes the value of `accountEmail` since it is declared with `let`.
   - `// accountCity = "Delhi"`  
     - This line is commented out but would work since `accountCity` is treated as a global variable (not recommended).

3. **Console Output:**
   - `console.table([...])`  
     - Displays data in a tabular format in the console.
     - The table includes the following:
       - `accoundId` (constant): **144553**  
       - `accountEmail` (reassigned): **"adityanv8@gmail.com"**  
       - `accountPassword` (var): **"12345"**  
       - `accountCity` (global): **"Greater Noida"**  
       - `accountState` (uninitialized): **`undefined`**

4. **Best Practices:**
   - **Avoid `var`:**  
     Variables declared with `var` are hoisted and have functional scope, which can lead to bugs. Use `let` or `const` instead.
   - **Use `const` when the value should not change:**  
     For values that do not require reassignment (e.g., `accoundId`), `const` is more suitable.
   - **Declare variables explicitly:**  
     Avoid creating global variables by omitting `let`, `const`, or `var` (e.g., `accountCity`).

5. **Key JavaScript Concepts:**
   - **`const`:** For variables whose value should remain constant. Immutable after declaration.
   - **`let`:** For block-scoped variables that may change later.
   - **`var`:** For functional-scoped variables. Not recommended due to block scope issues.
   - **Global Variables:** Created when assigning values to undeclared variables. Avoid this as it can lead to scope pollution.
   - **`undefined`:** Default value of variables declared but not initialized (e.g., `accountState`).

### **Table Representation of the Final Values**

| Property         | Value                     |
|------------------|---------------------------|
| `accoundId`      | `144553`                 |
| `accountEmail`   | `"adityanv8@gmail.com"`  |
| `accountPassword`| `"12345"`               |
| `accountCity`    | `"Greater Noida"`       |
| `accountState`   | `undefined`             |

By adhering to these best practices, your code becomes more predictable, readable, and free from unexpected behaviors caused by scope issues.

Prefer Not to use var
because of issue in block scope and functional scope
